        Paragraphs are an example of block elements because, by default,
        they take up the enitre width of the web page and add space at the
        top and bottom of the element.

        We showed the differene between block and inline elements using developper tools,
        which we accessed using Ctrl+Shif+I. Developper tools is helpful to show you the,
        exact code that is used to display a specific element and can show you the width,
        height, and spacing around an element.

        Anchors are an example of inline elements because, by default, 
        they only take up the space that they need to.

    This is an example of an image tag.
    The src attribute is the location of the image we want to display.
    The src attribute can be an internet location (i.e., https://www.google.com/...),
    But the best practice is to have your own images folder that stores all the
    images on your website.

    NOTE: img is a self closing tag.
