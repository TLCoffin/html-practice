    <h2>Plant Suggestions</h2>
    <!--
      The form tag is used to create a container where all the inputs for a form
      must be put inside.
      The attributes that are name, id, and method.

      name give some descriptive information about what the form will be used for.

      id allows us to reference this form later in fieldsets and other areas of our
      code

      method has two typical values: get and post. Get is used for forms that do 
      not ask for personal information (search bars, etc.). post is for forms 
      that ask for personal information (login and signup pages, etc.).
    -->
    <form name="plant-suggestions" id="plant" method="get">
      <!--
        This is a text input. type="text", name, and id are all required attributes.
        the required attribute is only nessesary when you want to make sure the user 
        has to fill in the input before submitting the form.

        The type attribute defines the type of input.
        The name attribute defines the variable name that would be used for the 
        input when the data gets passed to the server (requires back-end scripting,
        which is beyond the scope of this course).
        The id attribute allows us to reference the input from the label and from
        other parts of our code.

        All inputs need a label with the for attribute that links the label to the 
        input using the input's id attribute.
        When an input is required, it is important to include the word required
        in the labe's text.
      -->
      <label for="plant">Please Enter Your Favorite Plant [required]:</label>
      <input type="text" name="plant-type" id="plant" required />
      <br />
      <!--
        This is a password input. type="password", name and id are all required
        attributes.
        As always, each input needs a label with the for attribute to link the label
        to an input.

        I have commented this input out because I will not be needing a password
        input for this form.
      -->
      <!--
        <label for="password">Please Enter Your Password:</label>
        <input type="password" name="userPassword" id="password" />
      -->

      <!--
        A fieldset is an area in your form where you put inputs that are more related to each other
        than they are related to other inputs in the form.

        form is an important attribute to link the fieldset to the form it is related to.
      -->
      <fieldset form="plants">
        <!--
          Legend is text the appears above the fieldset and breaks the line of the fieldset box.
          It describes how the items in the fieldset are related.

        <!--
            This is a checkbox input. NOTE, this is an input where the input typically comes
            before the label.

            type="checkbox", name and id are all required. the value attribute is also required 
            and provides it's value to the server if the user checks the box and submits the form.
            In this case, what would be passed to the server is waterBottle=bottle.
