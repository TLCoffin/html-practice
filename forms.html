    <!--
        The formtag is used to create a container where all the inputs for a form
         must be put inside.
         The attributes that are name, id, and method.

         name give some descriptive information about what the form will be used for.

         id allows us to reference this form later in fieldsets and other areas of our
         code

         method has two typical values: get and post. Get is used for forms that do 
         not ask for personal information (search bars, etc.). post is for forms 
         that ask for personal information (login and signup pages, etc.).
    -->
    <form name="plant-suggestions" id="plant" method="get">
        <!--
            This is a text input. type="text", name, and id are all required attributes.
            the required attribute is only nessesary when you want to make sure the user 
            has to fill in the input before submitting the form.

            The type attribute defines the type of input.
            The name attribute defines the variable name that would be used for the 
            input when the data gets passed to the server (requires back-end scripting,
            which is beyond the scope of this course).
            The id attribute allows us to reference the input from the label and from
            other parts of our code.

            All inputs need a label with the for attribute that links the label to the 
            input using the input's id attribute.
            When an input is required, it is important to include the word required
            in the labe's text.
        -->
        <label for="plant">Please Enter Your Favorite Plant [required]:</label>
        <input type="text" name="plant-type" id="plant" required />
        <br />
        <!--
            This is a password input. type="password", name and id are all required
            attributes.
            As always, each input needs a label with the for attribute to link the label
            to an input.

            I have commented this input out because I will not be needing a password
            input for this form.
        -->
        <!--
            <label for="password">Please Enter Your Password:</label>
            <input type="password" name="userPassword" id="password" />
        -->
